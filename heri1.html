        <section class="one container">Sigiriya, also known as Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, is an archaeological site in central Sri Lanka, consisting of archaeological sites of an ancient fortress built on notable monolithic rock pillars in the second half of the 5th century AD. The rocks are so steep that their summits protrude from the sides, rising to a height of 1,144 feet (349 meters) above sea level and about 600 feet (180 meters) above the surrounding plains.</section>
        <section class="two container">King Kashyapa I of Sinhalese built a monumental lion-shaped palace on several hectares of the summit to serve as a protection from his enemies. However, the king was defeated in 495 and the palace was devastated. However, this place soon became a pilgrimage site and  is now a popular tourist attraction. Visitors begin their final climb to the summit through the open legs of the lion. One of the few remaining parts of the palace is still intact. Also noteworthy are the 21 rock paintings of Apsara (heavenly singer and dancer). Sigiriya was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982.</section>
        <section class="three container">Originally, the Mirror wall was so sophisticated that the king could see himself walking along the wall. The highly polished white plastered brick walls are now partially covered with poetry scribbled by visitors, some  dating back to the 8th century. However, most dates back to the 9th and 10th centuries. People from all disciplines, from poets to  governors to housewives, wrote on the wall. Even Bhikkhu was not exempt. They wrote poetry on a variety of subjects, including love, irony, and experiences of all kinds. This is the only evidence of poetry found during the Anuradhapura era.</section>
